# Reinforcement_Learning

Reinforcement Learning with TensorFlow, Allowing Machine to Learn Problems Autonomously  

At	the	end	of	the	course	students	should	be	able	to:
1. Given	a	business	problem	identify	if	reinforcement	learning	is	needed	to	solve	it	or	a	
different	technique  
2. Recognize	states,	the	role	of	an	agent,	its	actions,	and	environment	for	a	given	
reinforcement	learning problem  
3. Select	the	most	appropriate	reinforcement	learning	algorithm	for	a	problem	at	hand  
4. Implement	the	overall	solution	in	Python
