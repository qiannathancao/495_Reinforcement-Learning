Reinforcement	Learning for	Artificial	Intelligence  
Course	Description:  

Recent	breakthroughs	of	artificial	intelligence	in	games	such	as	Go	and	poker,	and	
advancements	in	robotics,	autonomous	cars,	manufacturing	scheduling	are	driven	by	
reinforcement	learning	where	an	agent	learns	in	real	time	based	on	an	ever-changing	
environment	and	receiving	a	reward	after	an	action	is	taken.	Combined	with	deep	learning,	
deep	reinforcement	learning	is	the	current	state-of-the-art.	  

This	course	covers	the	modeling	concepts	and	the	underlying	recursive	functions	behind	
reinforcement	learning.	A	substantial	part	of	the	material	is	devoted	to	modern	algorithms	for	
solving	the	underlying	model	including	deep	Q-networks,	policy	gradient,	Monte-Carlo	tree	
search,	and	actor-critic	algorithms.	Through	homework	assignments	and	projects,	students	
implement	and	evaluate	these	algorithms	in	Python.  

Course	Objectives:  
At	the	end	of	the	course	students	should	be	able	to:  
1. Given	a	business	problem	identify	if	reinforcement	learning	is	needed	to	solve	it	or	a	
different	technique
2. Recognize	states,	the	role	of	an	agent,	its	actions,	and	environment	for	a	given	
reinforcement	learning problem
3. Select	the	most	appropriate	reinforcement	learning	algorithm	for	a	problem	at	hand
4. Implement	the	overall	solution	in	Python
